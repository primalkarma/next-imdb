        Projections based on results coming out of various districts put the
        final tally for NPP over 150 seats, giving the alliance a rare
        two-thirds majority in the House, two months after Sri Lankans elected
        Mr. Dissanayake in a decisive election held after the country’s worst
        economic crisis since Independence.

        The NPP increased its vote share across the island but secured an
        especially remarkable mandate in the north and east that is home to
        Tamils and Muslims. The poll results in this region overturns the image
        of the NPP’s chief constituent Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna [JVP or
        People’s Liberation Front] as an “anti-Tamil rights” party, based on the
        JVP’s fierce opposition in the 1980s to Tamils’ self-rule and the merger
        of the north and east.

        Tamils and Muslims who voted for Mr. Dissanayake’s political rivals —
        mainly former Opposition Leader Sajith Premadasa — in the presidential
        election appear to have voted for the NPP, revealing its success in
        reaching out to ethnic minorities more recently. In almost all
        districts, barring Batticaloa in the east, the NPP beat prominent
        regional parties, representing Tamils and Muslims, signalling that the
        chant for change that dominated the Sinhala-majority south ahead of the
        September presidential polls had now travelled island-wide.
